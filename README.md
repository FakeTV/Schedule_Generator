# Schedule_Generator
For those of you interested in a less granular approach to creating schedules for each channel, this is for you.


Things that need to be added:
- Where do certain things go
- How do you actually setup csv file?
- What are the flags in Schedule_Generation.py that we can use to do certain things?
- What requirements are there to setup (really its makeing you you setup the plex ip address and token).

Ways to make better:
- Add the config file to correctly interact, so you don't have to retype the ip address and token.
